 ### ABOUT
For this project, I created a calculator using Python that has automated unit tests.

My calculator performs the following operations: 

1. addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. square
6. square root  

They correctly use static methods, object methods, object attributes / properties and contain files to load data for unit tests.
